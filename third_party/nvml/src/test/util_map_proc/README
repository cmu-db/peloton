This is src/test/util_map_proc/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_map_hint().

The program in util_map_proc.c takes a fake /proc/self/maps file
as an argument, along with a length.  It arranges for util_map_hint()
to open the fake /proc file when looking up the range.

	usage: util_map_proc maps_file len [len]...

len is interpreted as a decimal value unless it starts with 0x.
Each len is tested against the given maps-file.
