This is src/test/pmem_is_pmem/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_is_pmem().

The program in pmem_is_pmem.c takes a file as an argument, memory
maps that file, and prints out the return value from pmem_is_pmem()
on the resulting range.  For true persistent memory, 1 is the expected
output.  0 is the expected output for everything else.

The tests in this directory also check that the PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE
environment variable can be used to force a specific return value
from pmem_is_pmem().
