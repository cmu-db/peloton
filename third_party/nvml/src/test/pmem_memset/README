This is src/test/pmem_memset/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memset().

SYNOPSIS:
pmem_memset file offset length

DESCRIPTION:
	pmem_memset is the unit test for verifying the functionality of memset for
	persistent storage using non-temporal instructions.

OPTIONS:
	file is $DIR/testfile1 in all cases.
	offset: Is number of bytes for destination address offset based on a 64 byte
		boundary.
	length: Is the length specified in bytes. Cannot be less than 4.

In all cases it calls pmem_memset_persist with first a Z character and sets 1/4 of
the length specified in the destination location. It repeats this with an F character.

The file is read after processing the memcmp and a read of the file to ensure
contains the correct values.
