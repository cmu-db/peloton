This is src/test/pmem_memcpy/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memcpy().

SYNOPSIS:
pmem_memcpy file destoff srcoff length

DESCRIPTION:
pmem_memcpy is the unit test for verifying the functionality of
memcpy for persistent memory using non-temporal instructions.

OPTIONS:
	file is '$DIR/testfile1' for all tests.
	destoff: Is number of bytes for destination address offset based on
		a 64 byte boundary
	srcoff: Is number of bytes offset for source address based on
		64 byte boundary
	length: Is the length in bytes. Cannot be less than 4.

A zero for the dest offset and src offset are valid.

In all cases it sets a pattern of Z's and F's in 1/2 of the length specified to
be used as the source buffer. It then tests for successful memcpy using a
memcmp and a read of the file.
