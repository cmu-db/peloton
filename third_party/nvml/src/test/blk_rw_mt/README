This is src/test/blk_rw_mt/README.

This directory contains a unit test for MT reads & writes.

The program in blk_rw_mt.c takes a block size, a file, a random number
generator seed (to make the results repeatable), a thread count, and the
number of I/Os to do per thread.  For example:

	./blk_rw_mt 4096 file1 123 300 500

this will create a pool in file1 with block size 4096, fork 300 threads,
and each thread will do 500 random I/Os (50/50 reads/writes).
