This is src/test/blk_recovery/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk recovery. It works only
in non-debug mode.

The program in blk_recovery.c takes a block size, file and two LBAs.
A write to the first LBA is performed, then the arena map data structure
protections are modified to be read-only, then the remaining LBA is written.

For example:

	./blk_recovery 4096 file1 5 10

this will call pmemblk_open() on file1, call pmemblk_write() for LBA 5
(causing all the layout to be written), then it will change the memory
protection on the arena map area to read-only.  Next, pmemblk_write()
is called for for LBA 10 and SIGSEGV is caught and reported.  Finally,
pmemblk_check() is called.

This is not a perfect simulation of a system interruption, but does allow
creating a file where a write was interrupted before updating the map.
