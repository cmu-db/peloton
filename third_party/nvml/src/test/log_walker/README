This is src/test/log_walker/README.

This directory contains a unit test to verify pool's write-protection
in debug mode. It works only in debug mode.

The program in log_walker.c takes only a file name as an argument. For example:

	./log_walker file1

this calls pmemlog_open() on file1 and pmemlog_append() to append six strings
to the log. Next pmemlog_walk() is called and the walk handler tries to store
to the buffer and SIGSEGV is caught and reported.
