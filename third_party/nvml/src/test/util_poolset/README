This is src/test/util_poolset/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_pool_create()
and util_pool_open().

The program in util_poolset.c takes a command, minimal pool size, pool header
size along with the list of poolset file paths.

The 'command' could be:
    c - util_poolset_create()
    o - util_poolset_open()

For example:
	./util_poolset c minlen hdrsize path1

This will call util_pool_create() on path1 using minlen as minimal pool size
and hdrsize as pool header size.

minlen and hdrsize are interpreted as a decimal values unless they start with 0x.
