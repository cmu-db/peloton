This is src/test/vmem_delete/README.

This directory contains a unit test for the vmem_delete() function.

The program in vmem_delete.c takes operations as arguments. Operations
are encoded by characters. Each of them stands for one VMEM function:
	'h' - vmem_check()
	'f' - vmem_free()
	'm' - vmem_malloc()
	'c' - vmem_calloc()
	'r' - vmem_realloc()
	'a' - vmem_aligned_alloc()
	's' - vmem_strdup()
	'd' - vmem_delete()

At the beginning the program creates a memory pool of the minimum size
(VMEM_MIN_POOL) from an already memory-mapped region using
vmem_create_in_region(). Then it allocates some memory and deletes
the pool using vmem_delete(). Now the proper test begins. For each given
argument the appropriate function is called for the already deleted pool,
and a return status is printed or SIGSEGV is caught and reported.

For example:

	./vmem_delete f m a

this will call: vmem_free(), vmem_malloc() and vmem_aligned_alloc()
for the already deleted pool and print their return status. If SIGSEGV occurs,
it will be caught and reported for each of these functions.
