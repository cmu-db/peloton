This is src/test/pmem_map/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_map().

The program in pmem_map.c takes a file name as an argument.

Initially, the first 4k of the file is populated with some pattern
using write(). The file content is verified after successful mapping
with pmem_map(). Then, the program overwrites the first 4k of the
mapped memory region with another pattern, unmaps the file, and
verifies its content once again.  Since this test unmaps the file
with pmem_unmap(), it also tests that function by trying to access
the address after it was unmapped and verifying it can't.

Finally, the program re-opens the file with read-only access then
tries to map the file and prints an error message if pmem_map()
fails (which it should).
