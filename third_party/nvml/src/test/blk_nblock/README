This is src/test/blk_nblock/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_nblock().

The program in blk_nblock.c takes a list of block size file pairs.
For example:

	./blk_nblock 4096:file1

this will call pmemblk_open() on file1 and then report what pmemblk_nblock()
reports back as the usable size.
