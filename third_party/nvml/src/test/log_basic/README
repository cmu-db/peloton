This is src/test/log_basic/README.

This directory contains a unit test for:
- pmemlog_open
- pmemlog_close
- pmemlog_nbyte
- pmemlog_append
- pmemlog_appendv
- pmemlog_tell
- pmemlog_rewind
- pmemlog_walk
- pmemlog_check


The program in pmemlog.c takes a file name and a list of
operations encoded as characters as arguments. For example:

	./log_basic file1 a v r w t n

this will call a series of log iterations with some hardcoded arguments
as described in the table below:

	a - pmemlog_append
	v - pmemlog_appendv
	t - pmemlog_tell
	r - pmemlog_rewind
	w - pmemlog_walk
	n - pmemlog_nbyte
