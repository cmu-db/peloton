This is src/test/blk_rw/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemblk_read/write/set_zero/set_error.

The program in blk_rw.c takes a block size, file and a list of
operation:LBA pairs.  For example:

	./blk_rw 4096 file1 r:0 w:5 z:9 e:100

this will call pmemblk_open() on file1 and then pmemblk_read() for LBA 0,
pmemblk_write() for LBA 5, pmemblk_set_zero() for LBA 9, and pmem_set_error()
for LAB 100.

Each block written is filled up with the ordinal number of the write
operation (a block full of 8-bit 1s, then a block filled with 8-bit 2s,
etc.).  When a block is read, the number it was filled with is reported
(and the program verifies the entire block is filled with that number).
