This is src/test/pmem_memmove/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_memmove().

SYNOPSIS:
pmem_memmove file b:length [d:{offset}] [s:offset] [o:{1|2} S:{overlap}]

DESCRIPTION:
pmem_memmove is the unit test for verifying the functionality of
memmove for persistent memory storage using non-temporal instructions.

OPTIONS:
	file is '$DIR/testfile1' for all tests

	b: Use this option to specify the length in bytes of the data.
	d: Use this option to specify destination address offset in number of bytes.
	s: Use this option to specify source address offset in number of bytes.
	o: Use this option to specify that overlap in addresses is required. The
		value can be 1 or 2.
		1 =  source overlaps with dest, i.e. starting source address >
			starting destination address.
		2 =  destination overlaps with source, i.e. starting.
			destination address > starting source address.
	S: Number of bytes of overlap

Option o example:
	pmem_memmove b:4096 o:1 S:2

In this case the source will overlap with the destination. The number of bytes
overlap is two. For example,
	dest addr = 10000
	src addr = 10002

The src address is calculated based on the address for the mmapped file used as
the destination.

In all cases it sets a pattern of Z's and T's in 1/2 the length specified to
be used as the source buffer. It then tests for success by doing a memcmp and
reading the file directly.
