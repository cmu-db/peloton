This is src/test/log_recovery/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmemlog recovery. It works only
in non-debug mode.

The program in log_recovery.c takes a file name and an operation as arguments.
An operation is encoded as a character 'a' or 'v'. The first one means that
pmemlog_append() will be used to append data and the second one means that
pmemlog_appendv() will be used to do that. For example:

	./log_recovery file1 a

this will call pmemlog_open() on file1, call pmemlog_append() to append
six strings to the log and pmemlog_tell() to check the current write point,
then it will change the memory protection on the metadata area to read-only.
Next, pmemlog_append() is called again and SIGSEGV is caught and reported.
Finally, pmemblk_check() and pmemlog_tell() are called to make sure there are
no partial log entries.
