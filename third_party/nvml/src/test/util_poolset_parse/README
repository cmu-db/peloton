This is src/test/util_poolset_parse/README.

This directory contains unit tests for parsing a set file.

The program in util_poolset_parse.c takes a list of set file names.
For example:

	./util_poolset_parse ./myobjpool0.set ./myobjpool1.set

There are following test set files available:

	- TEST 0 - correct set file: one replica and comments
	- TEST 1 - incorrect set file: invalid signature of the set file
	- TEST 2 - incorrect set file: invalid the first line ("PMEMPOOLSET+")
	- TEST 3 - incorrect set file: invalid the first line ("PMEMPOOLSET X")
	- TEST 4 - incorrect set file: no pool set parts listed
	- TEST 5 - incorrect set file: invalid a pool set's part's line:
                   no path, only size given
	- TEST 6 - correct set file: one part, no replica
	- TEST 7 - incorrect set file: the "REPLICA" signature present,
                   but no replica parts listed
	- TEST 8 - incorrect set file: invalid "REPLICA" line ("REPLICA+")
	- TEST 9 - incorrect set file: invalid "REPLICA" line ("REPLICA X")
	- TEST 10 - incorrect set file: invalid replica's part's line:
                    no path, only size given
	- TEST 11 - correct set file: one part and one replica
	- TEST 12 - incorrect set file: sizes of pool set and replica mismatch
	- TEST 13 - incorrect set file: two replicas, no replica parts
                    of the first replica
	- TEST 14 - incorrect set file: two replicas, no replica parts
                    of the second replica
	- TEST 15 - incorrect set file: sizes of two replicas mismatch
	- TEST 16 - incorrect set file: sizes of pool set and the second
                    replica mismatch
	- TEST 17 - correct set file: one part and two replicas
	- TEST 18 - incorrect set file: invalid pool set's part's line:
                    invalid size (10X0G)
	- TEST 19 - incorrect set file: invalid pool set's part's line:
                    invalid size (100X)
	- TEST 20 - incorrect set file: invalid replica's part's line:
                    invalid size (10X0G)
	- TEST 21 - incorrect set file: invalid replica's part's line:
                    invalid size (100X)
	- TEST 22 - incorrect set file: invalid pool set's part's line:
                    invalid path (not an absolute path)
	- TEST 23 - incorrect set file: invalid replica's part's line:
                    invalid path (not an absolute path)
	- TEST 24 - correct set file with lower case size suffixes
	- TEST 25 - correct set file with no size suffixes
	- TEST 26 - correct set file with mixed size units
	- TEST 27 - incorrect set file: invalid size
                    double 'b'
	- TEST 28 - incorrect set file: invalid size
                    double unit
	- TEST 29 - incorrect set file with mixed size units
                    'B' followed by unit
