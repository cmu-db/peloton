This is src/test/util_file_open/README.

This directory contains a unit test for util_file_open().

The program in util_file_open.c takes a minimal pool size along with the
list of file paths.
For example:

        ./util_file_open minlen path1 path2

This will call util_file_open() on path1 and path2.

minlen is interpreted as a decimal value unless it starts with 0x.
