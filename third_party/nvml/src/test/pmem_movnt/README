Linux NVM Library

This is src/test/pmem_movnt/README.

This directory contains a unit test for MOVNT threshold check.

The program in pmem_movnt.c verifies if the correct variant of
pmem_memcpy, pmem_memmove and pmem_memset functions is used
depending on function arguments and the PMEM_MOVNT_THRESHOLD
environment variable settings.
