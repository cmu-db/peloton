This is src/test/obj_tx_locks/README.

This directory contains a unit test for transaction locks. At the beginning of
each transaction, the user may provide an arbitrary number of mutexes
and/or rwlocks, which will be taken before the transaction starts and released
at transaction end.

The obj_tx_locks application takes as command line arguments the file where the pool
will be created and the type of test to be performed (single or multi-threaded):

$ obj_tx_locks <file> [m]

Where:
	m - multi-threaded test

Some of the tests are performed using valgrind and its following tools:
	- drd
	- helgrind
