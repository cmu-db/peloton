This is src/test/obj_sync/README.

This directory contains a unit test for persistent synchronization mechanisms.
The types of synchronization primitives tested are: mutexes, rwlocks and
condition variables.

The obj_sync application takes as command line arguments the primitive type to
 be tested, the number of threads to be run and the number of times the test
 will be restarted:

$ obj_sync [mrc] <num_threads> <runs>

Where:
	m - test mutexes
	r - test rwlocks
	c - test condition variables

The tests are performed using valgrind and its following tools:
	- drd
	- helgrind
