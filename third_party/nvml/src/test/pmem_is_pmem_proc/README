This is src/test/pmem_is_pmem_proc/README.

This directory contains a unit test for pmem_is_pmem().

The program in pmem_is_pmem_proc.c takes a fake /proc/self/smaps file
as an argument, along with an address and a length.  It arranges for
pmem_is_pmem() to open the fake /proc file when looking up the range.

	usage: pmem_is_pmem_proc smaps-file addr len [addr len]...

addr is interpreted as a hex value, len as a decimal value unless it
starts with 0x.  Each addr/len pair is tested against the given smaps-file.
