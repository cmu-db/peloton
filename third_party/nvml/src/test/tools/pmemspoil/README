Linux NVM Library

This is src/test/tools/pmemspoil/README.

This directory contains a simple application for corrupting pool files.

This application may be used for testing purposes. One allows to modify every
single field in all structures used by NVML library.

Usage:
	$ pmemspoil <file> <field>=<value>...

<file>		- pool file
<field>		- name of field in structure to modify
<value>		- new value, for numerical fields you can use either decimal or
		  hexadecimal format with 0x prefix.

You can specify more than one field to modify at single call.

The format of <field> may contain multiple levels of structure fields and may
contain index of specified structure if there is more than one in a pool file.

The pmemspoil supports the following structures:
	- pool_hdr		- see util.h for details
	- pmemlog		- see log.h for details
	- pmemblk		- see blk.h for details
	- arena			- specify arena index
	- btt_info		- see btt_layout.h for details
	- btt_info_backup	- the same as btt_info but refers to BTT Info
				  backup header
	- btt_flog		- see btt_layout.h for details
	- btt_flog_prime	- the same as btt_flog but refers to second
				  instance of FLOG entry
	- btt_map		- BTT Map entries, see btt_layout.h for details


Examples:

In order to change pool_hdr's signature and start offset of pmemlog pool:
	$ pmemspoil /path/to/file pool_hdr.signature=ERROR\
				pmemlog.start_offset=0x0

For pmemblk pool file you can modify a signature in BTT Info header of second
arena using the following command:
	$ pmemspoil /path/to/file "arena(1).btt_info.sig=ERROR"

In order to change BTT Map entry number 20 and 5th flog sequence number in 3rd
arena:
	$ pmemspoil /path/to/file "arena(3).btt_map(20)=0x0"\
				"arena(3).btt_flog(5).seq=0xff"
