Linux NVM Library

This is examples/libpmemlog/logfile/README.

The example in this directory uses persistent memory to implement a
simple log file using libpmemlog.  To run this example, follow these steps:

0. Build the example with "make".  The libraries must be built first (i.e.
   by running "make" in ../../..).

1. Create the log file.  This can be anywhere but the point is it
   will be a much faster log file if it is created on a pmem-aware
   file system.  For example, if /pmem is the mount point for a
   pmem-aware file system:

	$ fallocate -l 1G /pmem/logfile

2. Append to the log file as many times as you like:

	$ addlog /pmem/logfile "Hello there."
	$ addlog /pmem/logfile "First line." "Second line."
	...

3. Print the contents of the log any time using:

	$ printlog /pmem/logfile

4. The printlog command will throw away the current log file contents
   after printing it if given the -t argument:

	$ printlog -t /pmem/logfile
