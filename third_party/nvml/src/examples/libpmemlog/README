Linux NVM Library

This is examples/libpmemlog/README.

This directory contains examples for libpmemlog, the library providing
pmem-resident log files.  Some of these examples are explained in more
detail here: http://pmem.io/nvml/libpmemlog

manpage.c is the example used in the libpmemlog man page.

logfile implements a simple log using libpmemlog.

To build these examples:
	make

These examples can be built against an installed system using:
	make LIBDIR=/usr/lib INCDIR=/usr/include

If you're looking for documentation to get you started using NVML,
start here: http://pmem.io/nvml and follow the links to examples and
man pages.  Developers new to NVML are probably looking for libpmemobj.
