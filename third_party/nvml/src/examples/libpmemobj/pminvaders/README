Linux NVM Library

This is examples/libpmemobj/pminvaders/README.

This directory contains an example application implemented using libpmemobj,
it's a game in which all the objects are stored on persistent memory.
This means that the game process can be safely killed and then resumed.

To launch the game:
	./pminvaders [game session file]

The file with the game session will either be created if it doesn't exist
or opened if it contains a valid pool.

Controls:
	move - arrow keys
	shoot - spacebar
	quit - 'q'

This game demonstrates the usage of the very basics of the pmemobj library,
that includes the pool management (open/create/close), type-safety macros,
non-transactional allocations and internal collections.

If you want to run this demo on non-pmem storage, set the PMEM_IS_PMEM_FORCE
environment variable, so that the library does not issue msync calls.
