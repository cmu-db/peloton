Linux NVM Library

This is examples/libpmemobj/pmemblk/README.

This directory contains an example implementation of libpmemblk using
libpmemobj. The implementation has exactly the same API as libpmemblk.

To launch the example:
	usage: obj_pmemblk [co] file blk_size [cmd[:blk_num[:data]]...]

Where:
    c - create file
    o - open file

The "cmd" arguments match the pmemblk functions:
    w - write to a block
    r - read a block
    z - zero a block
    n - write out number of available blocks

This example demonstrates the usage of the very basics of the pmemobj library.
That includes the pool management (open/create/close), type-safety macros,
transactions, transactional allocations and synchronization.

Please take note that this is only an example and does not implement full user
input validation, so for example creating the same pool twice yields undefined
behavior.
