Linux NVM Library

This is examples/libpmemobj/pmemlog/README.

This directory contains a set of example implementations of libpmemlog using
libpmemobj. All implementations have exactly the same API as libpmemlog, but
due to the different approaches to the implementation, some functions might
not be available.

To launch the examples:
    <executable_name> [co] file [cmd[:param]...]

Where:
    c - create file
    o - open file

 The "cmd" arguments match the pmemlog functions:
    a - append
    v - appendv
    r - rewind
    w - walk
    n - nbyte
    t - tell
"a" and "v" require a parameter string(s) separated by a colon.

Due to a different implementation obj_pmemlog_simple requires an additional
chunksize parameter for the walk function.

These examples demonstrate the usage of the very basics of the pmemobj library.
That includes the pool management (open/create/close), type-safety macros,
transactions, transactional allocations and synchronization.

Please take note that this is only an example and does not implement full user
input validation, so for example creating the same pool twice yields undefined
behavior.
