Linux NVM Library

This is examples/README.

This directory contains brief educational examples illustrating the use
of the NVM libraries.  For many of these examples, the Makefile rules
are here just to check that the example compiles, loads against the
appropriate library, and passes cstyle.

If you're looking for documentation to get you started using NVML,
start here: http://pmem.io/nvml and follow the links to examples and
man pages.  Developers new to NVML are probably looking for libpmemobj.

Many of the examples in this directory are described in more detail
on the above web site.
