Linux NVM Library

This is src/include/README.

This directory contains include files that are meant to be
installed on a system when the NVM Library package is installed.
These include files provide the public information exported
by the libraries that is necessary for applications to call into
the libraries.  Private include files, used only internally in
the libraries, don't live here -- they typically live next to
the source for their module.

Here you'll find:

libpmem.h -- definitions of libpmem entry points (see libpmem(3))

libpmemblk.h -- definitions of libpmemblk entry points (see libpmemblk(3))

libpmemlog.h -- definitions of libpmemlog entry points (see libpmemlog(3))

libpmemobj.h -- definitions of libpmemobj entry points (see libpmemobj(3))

libvmem.h -- definitions of libvmem entry points (see libvmem(3))

libvmmalloc.h -- definitions of libvmmalloc entry points (see libvmmalloc(3))
