	* Version 0.4
	This NVML version primarily focuses on improving code quality
	and reliability.  In addition to a couple of bug fixes,
	the changes include:
		- benchmarks for libpmemobj, libpmemblk and libvmem
		- additional pmemobj tests and examples
		- pool mapping address randomization
		- added pmempool "rm" command
		- eliminated libpmem dependency on libpthread
		- enabled extra warnings
		- minor performance improvements
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Beta quality" by the team, having
	been thoroughly validated, including significant performance analysis.
	The pmempool command does not yet support "check" and "repair"
	operations for pmemobj type pools.

	* Version 0.3
	NVML is now feature complete, adding support for:
		- pool sets
		- pmemobj local replication (active/passive)
		- experimental valgrind support
		- pmempool support for all pool types
	Man pages are all complete.
	This release is considered "Alpha quality" by the team, having
	gone through significant validation but only some performance
	analysis at this point.

	* Version 0.2
	NVML now consists of six libraries:
		- libpmem                            (basic flushing, etc)
		- libpmemblk, libpmemlog, libpmemobj (transactions)
		- libvmem, libvmmalloc               (volatile use of pmem)
	The "pmempool" command is available for managing pmem files.
	Man pages for all the above are complete.
	The only things documented in man pages but not implemented are:
		- pmem sets (ability to spread a pool over a set of files)
		- replication (coming for libpmemobj)
	The pmempool command does not yet support pmemobj type pools.
