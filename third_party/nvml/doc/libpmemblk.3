.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B libpmemblk
provides an array of blocks in
.I persistent memory
(pmem)
such that updates to a single block are atomic.
This library is intended for applications
using direct access storage (DAX),
which is storage that supports load/store access without
paging blocks from a block storage device.
Some types of
.I non-volatile memory DIMMs
(NVDIMMs)
provide this type of byte addressable access to storage.
A
.I persistent memory aware file system
is typically used to expose the direct access to applications.
Memory mapping a file from this type of file system
results in the load/store, non-paged access to pmem.
.B libpmemblk
builds on this type of memory mapped file.
.PP
This library is for applications that need a potentially large
array of blocks, all the same size, where any given block is
updated atomically (the update cannot be
.I torn
by program interruption such as power failures).
This library builds on the low-level pmem support provided by
.BR libpmem (3),
handling the transactional update of the blocks, flushing to
persistence, and recovery for the application.
.PP
.B libpmemblk
is one of a collection of persistent memory libraries available,
the others are:
.IP
.BR libpmemobj (3),
a general use persistent memory API,
providing memory allocation and transactional
operations on variable-sized objects.
.IP
.BR libpmemlog (3),
providing a pmem-resident log file.
.IP
.BR libpmem (3),
low-level persistent memory support.
.PP
Under normal usage,
.B libpmemblk
will never print messages or intentionally cause the process to exit.
The only exception to this is the debugging information, when enabled, as
described under
.B "DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING"
below.
.SH MOST COMMONLY USED FUNCTIONS
.PP
To use the atomic block arrays supplied by
.BR libpmemblk ,
a
.I memory pool
is first created.  This is done with the
.BR pmemblk_create ()
function described in this section.
The other functions
described in this section then operate on the resulting block
memory pool.
.PP
Once created, the memory pool is represented by an opaque handle,
of type
.IR "PMEMblkpool *" ,
which is passed to most of the other functions in this section.
Internally,
.B libpmemblk
will use either
.BR pmem_persist ()
or
.BR msync (2)
when it needs to flush changes, depending on whether
the memory pool appears to be persistent memory or a regular file
(see the
.BR pmem_is_pmem ()
function in
.BR libpmem (3)
for more information).
There is no need for applications to flush changes directly
when using the block memory API provided by
.BR libpmemblk .
.PP
.BI "PMEMblkpool *pmemblk_open(const char *" path ", size_t " bsize );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_open ()
function opens an existing block memory pool,
returning a memory pool handle used with most of the functions in this section.
.I path
must be an existing file containing a block memory pool as
created by
.BR pmemblk_create ().
The application must have permission to open the file and memory map
it with read/write permissions.
If the
.I bsize
provided is non-zero,
.BR pmemblk_open ()
will verify the given block size matches the block size used when
the pool was created.
Otherwise,
.BR pmemblk_open ()
will open the pool without verification of the block size. The
.I bsize
can be determined using the
.BR pmemblk_bsize ()
function.
If an error prevents the pool from being opened,
.BR pmemblk_open ()
returns NULL and sets errno appropriately.  A block size mismatch with the
.I bsize
argument passed in results in errno being set to EINVAL.
.PP
.BI "PMEMblkpool *pmemblk_create(const char *" path ", size_t " bsize ,
.br
.BI "    size_t " poolsize ", mode_t " mode );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_create ()
function creates a block memory pool with the given total
.I poolsize
divided up into as many elements of size
.I bsize
as will fit in the pool.  Since the transactional nature of
a block memory pool requires some space overhead in the memory
pool, the resulting number of available blocks is less than
.IR "poolsize / bsize" ,
and is made available to the caller via the
.BR pmemblk_nblock ()
function described below.  Given the specifics of the implementation,
the number of available blocks for the user cannot be less than 256.  This
translates to at least 512 internal blocks.
.I path
specifies the name of the memory pool file to be created.
.I mode
specifies the permissions to use when creating the file
as described by
.BR creat (2).
The memory pool file is fully allocated to the size
.I poolsize
using
.BR posix_fallocate (3).
The caller may choose to take responsibility for creating the memory
pool file by creating it before calling
.BR pmemblk_create ()
and then specifying
.I poolsize
as zero.  In this case
.BR pmemblk_create ()
will take the pool size from the size of the existing file and will
verify that the file appears to be empty by searching for any non-zero
data in the pool header at the beginning of the file.
The minimum
file size allowed by the library for a block pool is defined in
.B <libpmemblk.h>
as
.BR PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL .
.I bsize
can be any non-zero value,
however
.B libpmemblk
will silently round up the given size to
.BR PMEMBLK_MIN_BLK ,
as defined in
.BR <libpmemblk.h> .
.PP
Depending on the configuration of the system, the available space of
non-volatile memory space may be divided into multiple memory devices.
In such case, the maximum size of the pmemblk memory pool could be
limited by the capacity of a single memory device.
The
.B libpmemblk
allows building persistent memory resident array spanning multiple memory
devices
by creation of persistent memory pools consisting of multiple files, where
each part of such a
.I pool set
may be stored on different pmem-aware filesystem.
.PP
Creation of all the parts of the pool set can be done with the
.BR pmemblk_create ()
function.  However, the recommended method for creating pool sets
is to do it by using the
.BR pmempool (1)
utility.
.PP
When creating the pool set consisting of multiple files, the
.I path
argument passed to
.BR pmemblk_create ()
must point to the special
.I set
file that defines the pool layout and the location of all the parts of
the pool set.
The
.I poolsize
argument must be 0.
The meaning of
.I layout
and
.I mode
arguments doesn't change, except that the same
.I mode
is used for creation of all the parts of the pool set.
If the error prevents any of the pool set files from being created,
.BR pmemblk_create ()
returns NULL and sets errno appropriately.
.PP
When opening the pool set consisting of multiple files, the
.I path
argument passed to
.BR pmemblk_open ()
must not point to the pmemblk memory pool file, but to the same
.I set
file that was used for the pool set creation.
If an error prevents any of the pool set files from being opened,
or if the actual size of any file does not match the corresponding
part size defined in
.I set
file
.BR pmemblk_open ()
returns NULL and sets errno appropriately.
.PP
The set file is a plain
text file, which must start with the line containing a
.I "PMEMPOOLSET"
string,
followed by the specification of all the pool parts in the next lines.
For each part, the file size and the absolute path must be provided.
The minimum file size of each part of the pool set is the same as the
minimum size allowed for a block pool consisting
of one file.  It is defined in
.B <libpmemblk.h>
as
.BR PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL .
Lines starting with "#" character are ignored.
.PP
Here is the example "myblkpool.set" file:
.IP
.nf
PMEMPOOLSET
100G /mountpoint0/myfile.part0
200G /mountpoint1/myfile.part1
400G /mountpoint2/myfile.part2
.fi
.PP
The files in the set may be created by running the following command:
.IP
.nf
pmempool create blk <bsize> --from-set=myblkpool.set
.fi
.PP
.BI "void pmemblk_close(PMEMblkpool *" pbp );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_close ()
function closes the memory pool indicated by
.I pbp
and deletes the memory pool handle.  The block memory pool
itself lives on in the file that contains it and may be re-opened
at a later time using
.BR pmemblk_open ()
as described above.
.PP
.BI "size_t pmemblk_bsize(PMEMblkpool *" pbp );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_bsize ()
function returns the block size of the specified block memory pool.
It's the value which was passed as
.I bsize
to
.BR pmemblk_create ().
.I pbp
must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
.BR pmemblk_open ()
or
.BR pmemblk_create ().
.PP
.BI "size_t pmemblk_nblock(PMEMblkpool *" pbp );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_nblock ()
function returns the usable space in the block memory pool,
expressed as the number of blocks available.
.I pbp
must be a block memory pool handle as returned by
.BR pmemblk_open ()
or
.BR pmemblk_create ().
.PP
.BI "int pmemblk_read(PMEMblkpool *" pbp ", void *" buf ", off_t " blockno );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_read ()
function reads a block from memory pool
.IR pbp ,
block number
.IR blockno ,
into the buffer
.IR buf .
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set.
Reading a block that has never been written by
.BR pmemblk_write ()
will return a block of zeroes.
.PP
.BI "int pmemblk_write(PMEMblkpool *" pbp ", const void *" buf ", off_t " blockno );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_write ()
function writes a block from
.I buf
to block number
.I blockno
in the memory pool
.IR pbp .
The write is atomic with respect to other reads and writes.  In addition,
the write cannot be torn by program failure or system crash; on recovery
the block is guaranteed to contain either the old data or the new data,
never a mixture of both.
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set.
.PP
.BI "int pmemblk_set_zero(PMEMblkpool *" pbp ", off_t " blockno );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_set_zero ()
function writes zeros to block number
.I blockno
in memory pool
.IR pbp .
Using this function is faster than actually writing a block of zeros
since
.B libpmemblk
uses metadata to indicate the block should read back as zero.
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set.
.PP
.BI "int pmemblk_set_error(PMEMblkpool *" pbp ", off_t " blockno );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_set_error ()
function sets the error state for block number
.I blockno
in memory pool
.IR pbp .
A block in the error state returns errno EIO when read.  Writing the
block clears the error state and returns the block to normal use.
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set.
.SH LIBRARY API VERSIONING
.PP
This section describes how the library API is versioned,
allowing applications to work with an evolving API.
.PP
.BI "const char *pmemblk_check_version("
.br
.BI "    unsigned " major_required ,
.br
.BI "    unsigned " minor_required );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_check_version ()
function is used to see if the installed
.B libpmemblk
supports the version of the library API required by an application.
The easiest way to do this is for the application to supply the
compile-time version information, supplied by defines in
.BR <libpmemblk.h> ,
like this:
.IP
.nf
reason = pmemblk_check_version(PMEMBLK_MAJOR_VERSION,
                            PMEMBLK_MINOR_VERSION);
if (reason != NULL) {
    /*  version check failed, reason string tells you why */
}
.fi
.IP
Any mismatch in the major version number is considered a failure,
but a library with a newer minor version number will pass this
check since increasing minor versions imply backwards compatibility.
.IP
An application can also check specifically for the existence of
an interface by checking for the version where that interface was
introduced.  These versions are documented in this man page as follows:
unless otherwise specified, all interfaces described here are available
in version 1.0 of the library.  Interfaces added after version 1.0
will contain the text
.I introduced in version x.y
in the section of this manual describing the feature.
.IP
When the version check performed by
.BR pmemblk_check_version ()
is successful, the return value is NULL.  Otherwise the return value
is a static string describing the reason for failing the version check.
The string returned by
.BR pmemblk_check_version ()
must not be modified or freed.
.SH MANAGING LIBRARY BEHAVIOR
.PP
The library entry points described in this section are less
commonly used than the previous sections.
.PP
.BI "void pmemblk_set_funcs("
.br
.BI "    void *(*" malloc_func ")(size_t " size ),
.br
.BI "    void (*" free_func ")(void *" ptr ),
.br
.BI "    void *(*" realloc_func ")(void *" ptr ", size_t " size ),
.br
.BI "    char *(*" strdup_func ")(const char *" s ));
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_set_funcs ()
function allows an application to override memory allocation
calls used internally by
.BR libpmemblk .
Passing in NULL for any of the handlers will cause the
.B libpmemblk
default function to be used.
The library does not make heavy use of the system malloc functions, but
it does allocate approximately 4-8 kilobytes for each memory pool in use.
.PP
.BI "int pmemblk_check(const char *" path ", size_t " bsize );
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_check ()
function performs a consistency check of the file
indicated by
.I path
and returns 1 if the memory pool is found to be consistent.  Any
inconsistencies found will cause
.BR pmemblk_check ()
to return 0, in which case
the use of the file with
.B libpmemblk
will result in undefined behavior.  The debug version of
.B libpmemblk
will provide additional details on inconsistencies when
.B PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL
is at least 1, as described in the
.B "DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING"
section below. When
.I bsize
is non-zero
.BR pmemblk_check ()
will compare it to the block size of the pool and return 0 when they don't match.
.BR pmemblk_check ()
will return -1 and set errno if it cannot perform the
consistency check due to other errors.
.BR pmemblk_check ()
opens the given
.I path
read-only so it never makes any changes to the file.
.SH DEBUGGING AND ERROR HANDLING
.PP
Two versions of
.B libpmemblk
are typically available on a development system.
The normal version, accessed when a program is
linked using the
.B -lpmemblk
option, is optimized for performance.  That version skips checks
that impact performance and never logs any trace information or performs
any run-time assertions.  If an error is detected during the call to
.B libpmemblk
function, an application may retrieve an error message describing the
reason of failure using the following function:
.PP
.BI "const char *pmemblk_errormsg(void);
.IP
The
.BR pmemblk_errormsg ()
function returns a pointer to a static buffer containing the last error
message logged for current thread.  The error message may include
description of the corresponding error code (if errno was set), as returned by
.BR strerror (3).
The error message buffer is thread-local; errors encountered in one thread
do not affect its value in other threads.
The buffer is never cleared by any library function; its content is
significant only when the return value of the immediately preceding call to
.B libpmemblk
function indicated an error, or if errno was set.
The application must not modify or free the error message string,
but it may be modified by subsequent calls to other library functions.
.PP
A second version of
.BR libpmemblk ,
accessed when a program uses the libraries under
.BR /usr/lib/nvml_debug ,
contains run-time assertions and trace points.
The typical way to access the debug version is to set the environment variable
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to
.B /usr/lib/nvml_debug
or
.B /usr/lib64/nvml_debug
depending on where the debug libraries are installed on the system.
The trace points in the debug version of the library
are enabled using the environment variable
.BR PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL ,
which can be set to the following values:
.IP 0
This is the default level when
.B PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL
is not set.  No log messages are emitted at this level.
.IP 1
Additional details on any errors detected are logged (in addition
to returning the errno-based errors as usual).  The same information
may be retrieved using
.BR pmemblk_errormsg ().
.IP 2
A trace of basic operations is logged.
.IP 3
This level enables a very verbose amount of function call tracing
in the library.
.IP 4
This level enables voluminous and fairly obscure tracing information
that is likely only useful to the
.B libpmemblk
developers.
.PP
The environment variable
.B PMEMBLK_LOG_FILE
specifies a file name where all logging information should be written.
If the last character in the name is "-", the PID of the current process
will be appended to the file name when the log file is created.  If
.B PMEMBLK_LOG_FILE
is not set, the logging output goes to stderr.
.PP
Setting the environment variable
.B PMEMBLK_LOG_LEVEL
has no effect on the non-debug version of
.BR libpmemblk .
