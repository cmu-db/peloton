.SH NAME
pmempool-check \- Check and repair Persistent Memory Pool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmempool check
[<options>] <file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pmempool
invoked with
.B check
command checks consistency of a given pool file. If the pool file is consistent
.B pmempool
exits with 0 value. If the pool file is not consistent non-zero error code is
returned.

In case of any errors, the proper message is printed. The verbosity level may
be increased using
.B -v
option. The output messages may be also suppressed using
.B -q
option.

It is possible to try to fix encountered problems using
.B -r
