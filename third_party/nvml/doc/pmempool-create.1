.SH NAME
pmempool-create \- Create Persistent Memory Pool of specified type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmempool create
[<options>] [<type>] [<bsize>] <file>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pmempool
invoked with
.B create
command creates a pool file of specified type. Depending on a pool type it is
possible to provide more properties of pool.

Valid pool types are:
.BR blk ,
.BR log
and
.BR obj
which stands for
.IR pmem blk ,
.IR pmem log
and
.IR pmem obj
pools respectively.
By default the pool file is created with
.I minimum
allowed size for specified pool type. The minimum sizes for
.BR blk ,
.BR log
and
.BR obj
pool types are
.BR PMEMBLK_MIN_POOL ,
.BR PMEMLOG_MIN_POOL
and
.BR PMEMOBJ_MIN_POOL
respectively. See
.BR libpmemblk (3) ,
.BR libpmemlog (3)
and
.BR libpmemobj (3)
for details.

For
.IR pmem blk
pool type block size
.B <bsize>
is a required argument.

In order to set custom size of pool use
.B -s
option, or use
.B -M
option to create a pool of maximum available size on underlying file system.

The
.I size
argument may be passed with multiplicative suffixes K=1024, M=1024*1024
and so on for G, T and P or the suffixes KB=1000, MB=1000*1000 and so on for GB, TB and PB.
.SS "Available options:"
.PP
.B -s, --size
<size>
.RS 8
Size of pool file.
.RE
.PP
.B -M, --max-size
.RS 8
Set size of pool to available space of underlying file system.
.RE
.PP
.B -m, --mode
<octal>
.RS 8
Set permissions to <octal> (the default is 0664).
.RE
.PP
.B -i, --inherit
<file>
.RS 8
Create a new pool of the same size and other properties as
.B <file>.
.RE
.PP
.B -v, --verbose
.RS 8
Increase verbosity level.
.RE
.PP
.B -h, --help
.RS 8
Display help message and exit.
.RE
.SS "Options for PMEMBLK:"
.LP
By default when creating a pmem
.B blk
pool, the
.B BTT
layout is
.I not
written until the first
.I write operation
of block entry is performed. Using
.B -w
option you can force writing
.B BTT
layout by writing zero data to specified block number. By default the
.I write operation
is performed to block number
.BR 0 .
Please refer to
.BR libpmemblk (3)
for details.
.PP
.B -w, --write-layout
.RS 8
Force writing
.B BTT
layout by performing
.I write operation
to block number zero.
.RE
.SS "Options for PMEMOBJ:"
.LP
By default when creating a pmem
.B obj
pool, the layout name provided to the
.B libpmemobj
library is an empty string.
Please refer to
.BR libpmemobj (3)
for details.
.PP
.B -l, --layout <layout>
.RS 8
Layout name of the
.B pmemobj
pool.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
pmempool create blk 512 pool.blk
# Create a blk pool file of minimum allowed size and block size 512 bytes
.TP
pmempool create log -M pool.log
# Create a log pool file of maximum allowed size
.TP
pmempool create blk --size=4G --write-layout 1K pool.blk
# Create a blk pool file of size 4G, block size 1K and write BTT layout using
write operation to the block number 1
.TP
pmempool create --layout my_layout obj pool.obj
# Create an obj pool file of minimum allowed size and layout 'my_layout'
.TP
pmempool create --inherit=pool.log new_pool.log
# Create a pool file based on pool.log file
