`logo.svg` is the official logo for LogCabin.

In case you're wondering, no, those lines aren't straight. Every point on the
image is positioned by hand, poorly, intentionally.

The font used is called "Cabin", of course. It's available in the Debian
package `fonts-cabin` and from http://www.impallari.com/cabin/ under the SIL
Open Font License.

Additional files:

- `500px.png` is a 500 pixel-wide PNG export of `logo.svg` with a white background.
- `lasercut.svg` is a version of the logo optimized for laser cutting (the
  particular laser cutter I used couldn't handle images with invisible lines in
  the background, the chimney was enlarged, and a door was added).
- `LogCabin.gpl` is a GIMP/Inkscape color palette for the colors used in the logo.
- `sticker.svg` is a version of the logo optimized for printing to vinyl stickers
  (it has an enlarged chimney and door similar to the lasercut version, but
  retains the color from the logo; the roof is slightly enlarged on the left;
  on a 3x3" canvas).
