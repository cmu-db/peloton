        - [2013] Steven Feldman, Pierre LaBorde, Damian Dechev "Concurrent Multi-level Arrays:
                 Wait-free Extensible Hash Maps"

        [From the paper] The hardest problem encountered while developing a parallel hash map is how to perform
        a global resize, the process of redistributing the elements in a hash map that occurs when adding new
        buckets. The negative impact of blocking synchronization is multiplied during a global resize, because all
        threads will be forced to wait on the thread that is performing the involved process of resizing the hash map
        and redistributing the elements. \p %FeldmanHashSet implementation avoids global resizes through new array
        allocation. By allowing concurrent expansion this structure is free from the overhead of an explicit resize,
        which facilitates concurrent operations.

        The presented design includes dynamic hashing, the use of sub-arrays within the hash map data structure;
        which, in combination with <b>perfect hashing</b>, means that each element has a unique final, as well as current, position.
        It is important to note that the perfect hash function required by our hash map is trivial to realize as
        any hash function that permutes the bits of the key is suitable. This is possible because of our approach
        to the hash function; we require that it produces hash values that are equal in size to that of the key.
        We know that if we expand the hash map a fixed number of times there can be no collision as duplicate keys
        are not provided for in the standard semantics of a hash map.

        \p %FeldmanHashSet is a multi-level array which has an internal structure similar to a tree:
        @image html feldman_hashset.png
        The multi-level array differs from a tree in that each position on the tree could hold an array of nodes or a single node.
        A position that holds a single node is a \p dataNode which holds the hash value of a key and the value that is associated
        with that key; it is a simple struct holding two variables. A \p dataNode in the multi-level array could be marked.
        A \p markedDataNode refers to a pointer to a \p dataNode that has been bitmarked at the least significant bit (LSB)
        of the pointer to the node. This signifies that this \p dataNode is contended. An expansion must occur at this node;
        any thread that sees this \p markedDataNode will try to replace it with an \p arrayNode; which is a position that holds
        an array of nodes. The pointer to an \p arrayNode is differentiated from that of a pointer to a \p dataNode by a bitmark
        on the second-least significant bit.

        \p %FeldmanHashSet multi-level array is similar to a tree in that we keep a pointer to the root, which is a memory array
        called \p head. The length of the \p head memory array is unique, whereas every other \p arrayNode has a uniform length;
        a normal \p arrayNode has a fixed power-of-two length equal to the binary logarithm of a variable called \p arrayLength.
        The maximum depth of the tree, \p maxDepth, is the maximum number of pointers that must be followed to reach any node.
        We define \p currentDepth as the number of memory arrays that we need to traverse to reach the \p arrayNode on which
        we need to operate; this is initially one, because of \p head.

        That approach to the structure of the hash set uses an extensible hashing scheme; <b> the hash value is treated as a bit
        string</b> and rehash incrementally.

        @note Two important things you should keep in mind when you're using \p %FeldmanHashSet:
        - all keys must be fixed-size. It means that you cannot use \p std::string as a key for \p %FeldmanHashSet.
          Instead, for the strings you should use well-known hashing algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm">SHA1, SHA2</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash">MurmurHash</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityHash">CityHash</a>
          or its successor <a href="https://code.google.com/p/farmhash/">FarmHash</a> and so on, which
          converts variable-length strings to fixed-length bit-strings, and use that hash as a key in \p %FeldmanHashSet.
        - \p %FeldmanHashSet uses a perfect hashing. It means that if two different keys, for example, of type \p std::string,
          have identical hash then you cannot insert both that keys in the set. \p %FeldmanHashSet does not maintain the key,
          it maintains its fixed-size hash value.

        The set supports @ref cds_container_FeldmanHashSet_iterators "bidirectional thread-safe iterators".

        Template parameters:
        - \p GC - safe memory reclamation schema. Can be \p gc::HP, \p gc::DHP or one of \ref cds_urcu_type "RCU type"
        - \p T - a value type to be stored in the set
        - \p Traits - type traits, the structure based on \p feldman_hashset::traits or result of \p feldman_hashset::make_traits metafunction.
            \p Traits is the mandatory argument because it has one mandatory type - an @ref feldman_hashset::traits::hash_accessor "accessor"
            to hash value of \p T. The set algorithm does not calculate that hash value.

        There are several specializations of \p %FeldmanHashSet for each \p GC. You should include:
        - <tt><cds/container/feldman_hashset_hp.h></tt> for \p gc::HP garbage collector
        - <tt><cds/container/feldman_hashset_dhp.h></tt> for \p gc::DHP garbage collector
        - <tt><cds/container/feldman_hashset_rcu.h></tt> for \ref cds_intrusive_FeldmanHashSet_rcu "RCU type". RCU specialization
            has a slightly different interface.

            The set supports thread-safe iterators: you may iterate over the set in multi-threaded environment.
            It is guaranteed that the iterators will remain valid even if another thread deletes the node the iterator points to:
            Hazard Pointer embedded into the iterator object protects the node from physical reclamation.

            @note Since the iterator object contains hazard pointer that is a thread-local resource,
            the iterator should not be passed to another thread.

            Each iterator object supports the following interface:
            - dereference operators:
                @code
                value_type [const] * operator ->() noexcept
                value_type [const] & operator *() noexcept
                @endcode
            - pre-increment and pre-decrement. Post-operators is not supported
            - equality operators <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt>.
                Iterators are equal iff they point to the same cell of the same array node.
                Note that for two iterators \p it1 and \p it2, the conditon <tt> it1 == it2 </tt>
                does not entail <tt> &(*it1) == &(*it2) </tt>
            - helper member function \p release() that clears internal hazard pointer.
                After \p release() the iterator points to \p nullptr but it still remain valid: further iterating is possible.

            During iteration you may safely erase any item from the set;
            @ref erase_at() function call doesn't invalidate any iterator.
            If some iterator points to the item to be erased, that item is not deleted immediately
            but only after that iterator will be advanced forward or backward.

            @note It is possible the item can be iterated more that once, for example, if an iterator points to the item
            in array node that is being splitted.
