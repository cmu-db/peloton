# Security Advisories

This directory contains security advisories issued for Cap'n Proto.

Each advisory explains not just the bug that was fixed, but measures we are taking to avoid the class of bugs in the future.

Note that Cap'n Proto has not yet undergone formal security review and therefore should not yet be trusted for reading possibly-malicious input. Even so, Cap'n Proto intends to be secure and we treat security bugs no less seriously than we would had security review already taken place.

## Reporting Bugs
