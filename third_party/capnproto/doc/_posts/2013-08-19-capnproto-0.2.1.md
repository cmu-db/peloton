title: "Cap'n Proto v0.2.1: Minor bug fixes"
author: kentonv

Cap'n Proto was just bumped to v0.2.1.  This release contains a couple bug fixes, including
a work-around for [a GCC bug](http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58192).  If you were
observing any odd memory corruption or crashes in 0.2.0 -- especially if you are compiling with
GCC with optimization enabled but without `-DNDEBUG` -- you should upgrade.
