 * lookahead by replacing tokens here, in order to keep the grammar LALR(1).
 *
 * Using a filter is simpler than trying to recognize multiword tokens
 * directly in scan.l, because we'd have to allow for comments between the
 * words.  Furthermore it's not clear how to do that without re-introducing
 * scanner backtrack, which would cost more performance than this filter
 * layer does.
 *
 * The filter also provides a convenient place to translate between
 * the core_YYSTYPE and YYSTYPE representations (which are really the
 * same thing anyway, but notationally they're different).
