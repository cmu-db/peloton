 *	  PostgreSQL generic bitmap set package
 *
 * A bitmap set can represent any set of nonnegative integers, although
 * it is mainly intended for sets where the maximum value is not large,
 * say at most a few hundred.  By convention, a NULL pointer is always
 * accepted by all operations to represent the empty set.  (But beware
 * that this is not the only representation of the empty set.  Use
 * bms_is_empty() in preference to testing for NULL.)

 * This is a well-known cute trick for isolating the rightmost one-bit
 * in a word.  It assumes two's complement arithmetic.  Consider any
 * nonzero value, and focus attention on the rightmost one.  The value is
 * then something like
 *				xxxxxx10000
 * where x's are unspecified bits.  The two's complement negative is formed
 * by inverting all the bits and adding one.  Inversion gives
 *				yyyyyy01111
 * where each y is the inverse of the corresponding x.  Incrementing gives
 *				yyyyyy10000
 * and then ANDing with the original value gives
 *				00000010000
 * This works for all cases except original value = zero, where of course
 * we get zero.
