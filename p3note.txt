TableScanTranslator::Produce() produce all tuples (src/codegen/operator/table_scan_translator.cpp:61)

table_.GenerateScan() scab the table and hand to consumer

GetTileGroup() get the tile group (there is a GetTileGroupId() next to it, may take into consideration)

GetTileGroup() is runtime_function_proxy, it calls
storage::DataTable::GetTileGroup()

storage::DataTable::GetTileGroup() calls 
storage::DataTable::GetTileGroupById()

my plan:

add encode/decode function to tile group


Now, row level.
zone map is okay, since it is set before tile being encoded

table_scan_translator.cpp: void TableScanTranslator::ScanConsumer::ProcessTuples

SetupRowBatch

First, batch is formed and pushed into pipeline, the real value of tuple is got from bufferconsumer:
CompileAndExecutePlan->...->consumeResult->DeriveValue->Access(table_scan_translator.cpp)->loadColumn (table_scan_translator.cpp)->loadColumn (codegen/tile_group.cpp)

It will be the best if we can store the vector in heap

use columnlayout, add a new ptr, pointing to the address of vector, and a boolean to indicate whether 
this column is encoded.

The core shit: GetColumnLayouts, columnLayouts (codegen/tile_group.cpp and h) and columnlayoutInfo (runtimefunctions.h and cpp)


yes, it is fucking load column.
