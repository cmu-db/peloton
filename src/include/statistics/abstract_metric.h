/**
 * @brief Interface representing a metric.
 * A metric is defined to be some piece of logic that processes events generated
 * by the database. @see StatsEventType for a list of available events.
 * It is guaranteed that the appropriate callback method (identified by the
 * naming pattern On[event name]) is invoked and the args filled out with
 * relevant information. To enable safe and efficient collection of data,
 * it is required that all data be collected be written to a RawData
 * object, @see AbstractRawData.
 *
 * While you could write your own metric directly extending from this class,
 * it is recommended that you use @see AbstractMetric class, which takes in
 * an AbstractRawData class a a template argument and implements the tricky
 * concurrent code for you.
 *
 * To write a new Metric, first write your own RawData class, extending from
 * AbstractRawData, and extend from AbstractMetric with your RawData class as
 * template argument. Then, override the event callbacks that you wish to know
 * about. @see AbstractMetric on how to deal with concurrency.

   * Data from a metric is collected first into a thread-local storage to
   * ensure efficiency and safety, and periodically aggregated by an aggregator
   * thread into meaningful statistics. However, new statistics can still come
   * in when we aggregate, resulting in race conditions. To avoid this, every
   * time the aggregator wishes to aggregate data, the RawData object is
   * extracted and a fresh one swapped in, so collection continues seamlessly
   * while the aggregator is working.
   *
   * Unless you know what you are doing, you should probably just use the one
   * implemented for you(@see AbstractMetric). Otherwise, it is guaranteed that
   * this method is only called from the aggregator thread, so it is okay to
   * block in this method. As soon as this method returns, the aggregator
   * assumes that it is safe to start reading from the data and discards the
   * data after it's done. Therefore, it is essential that any implementation
   * ensures this method does not return if the collecting thread still can
   * write to the old raw data.
