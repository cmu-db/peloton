# Component Name

## Overview

>What motivates this to be implemented? What will this component achieve? 

## Scope
>Which parts of the system will this feature rely on or modify? Write down specifics so people involved can review the design doc

## Glossary (Optional)

>If you are introducing new concepts or giving unintuitive names to components, write them down here.

## Architectural Design
>Explain the input and output of the component, describe interactions and breakdown the smaller components if any. Include diagrams if appropriate.

## Design Rationale
>Explain the goals of this design and how the design achieves these goals. Present alternatives considered and document why they are not chosen.

## Testing Plan
>How should the component be tested?

## Trade-offs and Potential Problems
>Write down any conscious trade-off you made that can be problematic in the future, or any problems discovered during the design process that remain unaddressed (technical debts).

## Future Work
>Write down future work to fix known problems or otherwise improve the component.
