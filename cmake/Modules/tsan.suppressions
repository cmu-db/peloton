# In forestdb plock_lock is invoked from a lock structure that is sure to not
# overlap with that of another thread by use of is_overlapped() test.
# However since this function is not trusted by ThreadSanitizer it reports
# a lock inversion since the locks in the race are from the same struct definition
# but different memory addresses. This is hence a false positive.
